              <p>San Franciscans have long worried that the future is bleak, that the “real” city is in danger of disappearing forever. But these days, it’s hard not to look around and wonder if the nostalgic cynics and apocalyptic doomsayers might finally be right.</p>
              <p>The San Francisco of 2015 is a city where the median house price tops $1 million. Where venture capitalists spent $6.1 billion on companies in the second quarter of this year. Where vending machines dispense juice that costs $10 and a bowl of chili in formerly working-class Bernal Heights costs $15.</p>

              <p>In a city where political activism is an art form — we often lead the way in cultural shifts, like the change in attitude on same-sex marriage — the focus is on crafting apps that help people hire someone to park the car, remind boyfriends to send flowers and ensure we never have to pack our own bag for a business trip.</p>
              <p>Is the emperor wearing no clothes? Not even a tech-logo hoodie? Is  this bubble about to burst? Or is this the birth of a strange, self-absorbed city of ever-more-glaring extremes?</p>
              <p>We do know this: Not everyone is enamored with today’s San Francisco.</p>
              <p>Brendan Maloney, a school district carpenter who started an online apparel company called San Francisco Native in his spare time, wishes he could buy a home in the city where he was born and raised. Too bad he doesn’t have a million in cash sitting around.</p>
              <p>“You see Maseratis driving down Cabrillo Street in the Richmond District,” he said. “It’s absurd.”</p>

              <p>Comedian Lisa Geduldig produces the only-in-San Francisco Kung Pao Kosher Comedy, a Jewish comedy show at a Chinatown restaurant on Christmas. She has lived at 17th and Guerrero streets in the Mission for 26 years.</p>
              <p>“I live one block away from Valencia Street, where there’s a new restaurant that opens up every 15 minutes. How many chocolate shops does Valencia need?” she said. “Everything is insane. So much of it is like, ‘Is this an Onion article or not an Onion article that people are posting on Facebook?’”</p>
              <p>That one she saw about a one-bedroom apartment for rent in the Mission for $6,800 a month? Not an Onion article.</p>
              <p>“I did the math: $80,000 for rent for a year?” she said. “You could buy three houses in Buffalo, N.Y.”</p>
              <p>Clearly, this is a moment worth documenting, if only so future San Franciscans can think either: “Those people were nuts” — or, perhaps, “Remember the good old days when you could get a one-bedroom in the Mission for $6,800?”</p>

                  Now that once-raffish Dogpatch is a hot address, no wonder that the owner of a self-storage center on Mariposa Street next to I-280 wants to build housing there. But get this: The 17 “penthouse” units would be <em>on top of </em>the existing four-story facility. At least residents won’t need to check <a href="http://www.511.org/">511.org</a> for traffic conditions, because the elevated roadway will be right outside their windows.

<p class="timeline-center blue-border"><span class="subhead blue-text">It’s in the bag (we hope)</span>Business travel got you down? Sluff off that pesky packing chore with DUFL — also app, not crap. (OK, we confess, everything in here is real. That’s the point.) Like just about every task a wealthy tech executive may have on his to-do list, packing too can be farmed out with an app and lots of cash. <a href="http://www.dufl.com/">DUFL</a>, which has an office on Natoma Street, allows you to store your clothes in a personal closet and pick which pieces you want to pack for each trip virtually. Clean and neat clothes will be waiting for you at your destination. It costs $9.95 a month to have a closet and $99 per trip.</p>

One that took our breath away was <a href="http://www.spire.io/?gclid=CJrYtvDM_8cCFZJgfgodsKQIIQ">Spire</a>, a $149.95 device that can be clipped to your belt or bra to track whether you’re breathing deeply enough. Intended to reduce stress, it sends notifications when you need to breathe more deeply. It can also track your breathing over time to show when you’re stressed, where you tend to be stressed and what tends to stress you out. Constant notifications? Seems stressful, but the Third Street company does have prominent backers including UCSF.</p>

One is <a href="http://zirx.com/">Zirx</a>, the other <a href="http://www.luxe.com/">Luxe</a>.

Venture capitalists have poured $50 million into <a href="http://www.shyp.com/">Shyp</a>, which premiered last year with the slogan “We’ll take it from here.” The idea is that letting someone else deal with wrapping items and sending them off is a noble endeavor, so much so that the “couriers” who show up at your door are also called “heroes.” As long as your credit is good, they’re at your service.</p>
